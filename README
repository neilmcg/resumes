Time to learn this Ruby on Rails thing.

My "Stories"

A user can sign up as a user or a recruiter, marked as a boolean field "recruiter" in user model

A user can create a profile
A user can upload resumes in PDF form, viewable from their profile
A user can make their profile and attached resume public or private, although certain fields will always be public (i.e. tags)

Anyone can view public profiles, even if not logged in
Anyone can view certain public fields of private profiles (i.e. tags)

A user with a private profile can give access to view to any other user, including recruiters
A user with a private profile can revoke access
A recruiter can request access to view a certain profile

Notes
-Should there be a resume model for attachment_fu?
